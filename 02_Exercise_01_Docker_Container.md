In this assignment you are to set up run an nginx webserver, a mysql server and a httpd (Apache) server. 

The following is to be achieved:

1. All three servers should run in the background.
2. Make sure you differentiate the ports with which you instantiate the containers on the host.
3. The names of the containers should not be created automatically.
4. Are you able to find the mysql generated random password?
5. Clean up your entire environment once done.
6. Verify whether the environment has been cleaned up.

For this excersize you may need to refer to the docker hub for best practices in instantiating the respective containers as well as documentation found at docs.docker.com.
